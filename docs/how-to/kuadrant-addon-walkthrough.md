# Kuadrant operator addon

## Introduction
The following walkthrough will show you how to install/setup the Kuadrant operator via OCM (Open cluster management addons)

**_NOTE:_** :exclamation: A good walkthrough to have done before this is [Open Cluster Management and Multi-Cluster gateways](ocm-control-plane-walkthrough.md)


## Prerequisites
* Kind 

## Open terminal sessions
For this walkthrough, we're going to use multiple terminal sessions/windows, all using `multicluster-gateway-controller` as the `pwd`.

Open 2 windows, which we'll refer to throughout this walkthrough as:

* `T1` (Hub/control plane cluster, Where we'll run our controller locally)
* `T2` (Hub/control plane cluster)
* `T3` (Spoke/workload cluster 1)

## Setup up local environment
1. Clone this repo locally
2. In `T1` run the following command to bring up the kind clusters. The number of spoke cluster you want is dictated by the env var `MGC_WORKLOAD_CLUSTERS_COUNT`

    ```bash
    make local-setup-kind MGC_WORKLOAD_CLUSTERS_COUNT=1
    ```
    > :sos: Linux users may encounter the following error:
    > `ERROR: failed to create cluster: could not find a log line that matches "Reached target .*Multi-User System.*|detected cgroup v1"
    > make: *** [Makefile:75: local-setup] Error 1ERROR: failed to create cluster: could not find a log line that matches "Reached target .*Multi-User System.*|detected cgroup v1"
    > make: *** [Makefile:75: local-setup] Error 1` 
    > This is a known issue with Kind. [Follow the steps here](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/known-issues/#pod-errors-due-to-too-many-open-files) to resolve it.
3. In `T1` run the following command to deploy onto freshly created kind clusters
    ```bash
    make local-setup-mgc MGC_WORKLOAD_CLUSTERS_COUNT=1
    ```

### Running the addon manager controller and deploying Kuadrant resources


> **_NOTE:_** :exclamation: Your terminal should have the context of the Hub cluster or the control plane cluster. This is by default the context after you run the `make local-setup-mgc`. To get the context run the following command
     `kind export kubeconfig --name=mgc-control-plane --kubeconfig=$(pwd)/local/kube/control-plane.yaml && export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/local/kube/control-plane.yaml`

1. In `T1` run the following to bring up the controller.
    ```bash
    make run-ocm
    ```
1. Update the managed cluster addon `namespace` to the spoke cluster name you want to deploy Kuadrant to e.g `kind-mgc-workload-1`. Then in `T2` deploy it to the hub cluster
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f config/kuadrant/deploy/hub
    ```  
1. In the `T3` change the context to the workload cluster via 
    ```bash
    kind export kubeconfig --name=mgc-workload-1 --kubeconfig=$(pwd)/local/kube/workload1.yaml && export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/local/kube/workload1.yaml`
    ```    
1. In `T3` Running the following:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n kuadrant-system
    ```
    you should see the namespace `kuadrant-system` be created and the following pods come up:
* authorino-*value*
* authorino-operator-*value*
* kuadrant-operator-controller-manager-*value*
* limitador-*value*
* limitador-operator-controller-manager-*value*

## Clean up local environment
In any terminal window target control plane cluster by:
```bash
kubectl config use-context kind-mgc-control-plane 
```
If you want to wipe everything clean consider using:
```bash
make local-cleanup # Remove kind clusters created locally and cleanup any generated local files.
```
If the intention is to cleanup kind cluster and prepare them for re-installation consider using:
```bash
make local-cleanup-mgc MGC_WORKLOAD_CLUSTERS_COUNT=1 # prepares clusters for make local-setup-mgc
```
