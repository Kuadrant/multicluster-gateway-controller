# Defining a basic DNSPolicy

## What is a DNSPolicy

DNSPolicy is a Custom Resource Definition supported by the Multi-Cluster Gateway Controller (MGC) that follows the
[policy attachment model](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/policy-attachment/),
which allows users to enable and configure DNS against the Gateway  leveraging an existing cloud based DNS provider.

This document describes how to enable DNS by creating a basic DNSPolicy

## Pre-requisites

* A [ManagedZone](../managed-zone.md) has been created
* A Gateway has been created
* A HTTPRoute has been created and attached to the Gateway (Note: It's not a
requirement to create the HTTPRoute beforehand, but DNS records will only
be created once a DNSPolicy has been created)

> See [the Multicluster Gateways walkthrough](../how-to/multicluster-gateways-walkthrough.md) for step by step
instructions on deploying these with a simple application.

## Steps

The DNSPolicy will target the existing Multi Cluster Gateway, resulting in the
creation of DNS Records for each of the Gateway listeners backed by a managed zone,
ensuring traffic reaches the correct gateway instances and is balanced across them, as well as optional DNS health checks and load balancing.

In order to enable basic DNS, create a minimal DNSPolicy resource

```yaml
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: DNSPolicy
metadata:
  name: basic-dnspolicy
  namespace: <Gateway namespace>
spec:
  targetRef:
    name: <Gateway name>
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway     
```

Once created, the multi-cluster Gateway Controller will reconcile the DNS records.
By default it will setup a round robin / evenly weighted set of records to ensure a balance of traffic across each provisioned gateway instance. You can see the status by querying the DNSRecord resources.

```sh
kubectl get dnsrecords -A
```

The DNS records will be propagated in a few minutes, and the application will
be available through the defined hosts.

## Advanced DNS configuration

The DNSPolicy supports other optional configuration options like geographic and
weighted load balancing and health checks. For more detailed information about these options, see [DNSPolicy](./dnspolicy.md)
