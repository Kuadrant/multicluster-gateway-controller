# multicluster-gateway-controller

## Description:

The multi-cluster gateway controller, leverages the gateway API standard and Open Cluster Management to provide multi-cluster connectivity and global load balancing

Key Features:

- Central Gateway Definition that can then be distributed to multiple clusters
- Automatic TLS and cert distribution for HTTPS based listeners
- DNSPolicy to decide how North-South based traffic should be balanced and reach the gateways
- Health checks to detect and take remedial action against unhealthy endpoints
- Cloud DNS provider integrations (AWS route 53) with new ones being added (google DNS)


When deploying the multicluster gateway controller using the make targets, the following will be created: 
* Kind cluster(s)
* Gateway API CRDs in the control plane cluster
* Ingress controller
* Cert manager
* ArgoCD instance
* K8s Dashboard
* LetsEncrypt certs
	


## Prerequisites:
* AWS or GCP
* Various dependencies installed into $(pwd)/bin e.g. kind, yq etc.
  * Run `make dependencies`
* openssl>=3
    * On macOS a later version is available with `brew install openssl`. You'll need to update your PATH as macOS provides an older version via libressl as well
    * On Fedora use `dnf install openssl`
* go >= 1.20

### 1. Running the controller in the cluster:
1. Set up your DNS Provider by following these [steps](https://github.com/Kuadrant/multicluster-gateway-controller/tree/main/docs/how-to/providers/providers.md#setting-up-dns-provider)

1. Setup your local environment 
    ```sh
    make local-setup MGC_WORKLOAD_CLUSTERS_COUNT=<NUMBER_WORKLOAD_CLUSTER>
    ```  
1. Build the controller image and load it into the control plane
    ```sh
   kubectl config use-context kind-mgc-control-plane 
   make kind-load-controller
    ```

1. Deploy the controller to the control plane cluster
    ```sh
    make deploy-controller
    ```

1. (Optional) View the logs of the deployed controller
    ```sh
    kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get pods -n multi-cluster-gateways | grep "mgc-" | awk '{print $1}') -n multi-cluster-gateways
    ```

## 2. Running the controller locally:
1. Set up your DNS Provider by following these [steps](https://github.com/Kuadrant/multicluster-gateway-controller/tree/main/docs/how-to/providers/providers.md#setting-up-dns-provider)

1.  Setup your local environment 

    ```sh
    make local-setup MGC_WORKLOAD_CLUSTERS_COUNT=<NUMBER_WORKLOAD_CLUSTER>
    ```

1. Run the controller locally:
    ```sh
    kubectl config use-context kind-mgc-control-plane 
    make build-controller install run-controller
    ```

## 3. Running the agent in the cluster:
1. Build the agent image and load it into the workload cluster
    ```sh
    kubectl config use-context kind-mgc-workload-1 
    make kind-load-agent
    ```

1. Deploy the agent to the workload cluster
    ```sh
    make deploy-agent
    ```
    
## 4. Running the agent locally
1. Target the workload cluster you wish to run on:
```sh
export KUBECONFIG=./tmp/kubeconfigs/mgc-workload-1.kubeconfig
```
1. Run the agent locally:
```sh
make build-agent run-agent
```
